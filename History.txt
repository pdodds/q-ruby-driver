  * Read/write is done in a single-pass
  * Improved overall performance by streamlining array operations; especially for read/write vector types
  * Refactored connection logic and added detection of message length (to improve handling of long result sets)
  * Added broader support for conversion to/from native Ruby types, including Bignum=>long, Float=>float, Symbol=>symbol, Hash=>flip, and TrueClass/FalseClass=>boolean. Date/Time types not yet natively supported.
  * Added detection logic for Ruby Array to determine whether to convert to a Q vector or list
  * Added unit-tests which work in absence of a Q service to which to connect
  * Added distinction between QException (server side) and QIOException (client side)
  * Moved encode/decode methods from QMessage to new QIO class (with naming convention read/write)
  * Renamed QInstance => QConnection to be consistent with naming found in other Ruby SQL drivers
  * Deprecated QMessage class
